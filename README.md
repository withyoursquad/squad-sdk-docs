# Squad SDK Documentation

This repository contains the source code and assets for the Squad SDK documentation site.

## About Squad SDK

The Squad SDK enables developers to integrate Squad's social features, voice calling, freestyles, polls, and more into their mobile applications through a seamless WebView integration. The SDK handles initialization with organization credentials, user authentication, and provides an easy way to present the Squad experience within a partner app.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized by platform:

- `ios/`: iOS SDK documentation
- `android/`: Android SDK documentation (coming soon)
- `react-native/`: React Native SDK documentation (coming soon)

Within each platform directory, you'll find:

- `getting-started.md`: Quick start guide
- `api/`: Detailed API references
- Various guides and tutorials covering SDK initialization, user authentication, WebView integration, and more

The `assets/` directory contains images and other files used in the docs.
